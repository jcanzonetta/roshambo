Basic rock paper scissors.

The task was to make a rock paper scissors game that asked the user to play 5 rounds against a computer.

Improvements that can be made:

- Better tie recognition: currently a tie counts towards the 5 games.
- Winner of Game vs Round: currently do not track whether the user won the majority of the games.
- Add HTML: Everything is done in the console.
